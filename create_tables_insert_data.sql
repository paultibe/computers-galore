2. A single SQL script that can be used to create all the tables and data in the database. 
If you are using multiple scripts while developing, ensure you concatenate them and hand in only a SINGLE SQL script.

    a. Non-trivial size: make sure that your queries have some non-trivial answers 
        (e.g., division for only 2 products is trivial)â€”and the same idea with aggregation (Group By), 
        in general, because you need to have a reasonable number of groups), and you need to have some groups that have more than one row.
    b. This SQL script should be runnable as is (i.e., if we transferred this file to the
        undergrad servers, we should be able to run it as is without further tweaking).
